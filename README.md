# Loan_risk_analysis
Used different models of machine learning to predict whether loan will be paid or not.
Cleaned data using R Amelia to identify and impute missing data. 
Built prediction models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network and Naive Bayes. 
Measured model performance using accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, F1 and area under the ROC curve.
